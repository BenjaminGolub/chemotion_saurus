The Chemotion ELN supports the upload of in principle every dataset that is provided. The file size restriction is set by the admin of the Chemotion ELN instance and can be adjusted to your needs. If open file formats are available, spectra viewers can visualize the data set and allow the editing. In the moment the Chemotion ELN supports ChemSpectra as data viewer. NMRium will be implemented soon.

## ChemSpectra

This section will offer a brief overview over ChemSpectra and its functions, an in-depth description was published under an open access license [here](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-020-00481-0).

ChemSpectra is a web-based software for the visualization and analysis of spectroscopic data and allows the analysis of data attached to a sample or reaction in the Chemotion ELN. The focus of ChemSpectra is on analytical methods used in synthetic organic chemistry; infrared spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy (one dimensional 1H and 13C). The tool supports the open file formats JCAMP-DX (jdx) and mz(X)ML. Furthermore, it can support RAW and FID files. The user interface of ChemSpectra for the different analytical methods is identically, while the tools are selected to fit to the unique requirements of the different analytical methods. The user interface of the ChemSpectra is shown here:

The tools needed (peak picking, integration, multiplicity, reference) for the analysis of the spectra can be accessed through the toolbar in the upper left corner of the user interface (red box). ChemSpectra can obtain the frequency and used solvent of the NMR experiment from the uploaded data. Additionally, ChemSpectra will automatically predict the NMR spectra based on the [NMRshiftDB](https://nmrshiftdb.nmr.uni-koeln.de) (green box) and pick peaks, which are above the user defined threshold. The threshold can be defined, and the solvent corrected in the upper right corner (black box). The analysis of the spectra can be submitted into the Chemotion ELN through the blue arrow (blue box) in the upper right corner. After submitting the peak list (green box) is generated automatically and can be further modified by the user.
