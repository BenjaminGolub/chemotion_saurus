:::info
Documentation and processes are being reworked and improved at the moment. Please [contact](specific_contact) us for installation of a development version of the ELN.

:::


## Introduction
Containers enable the use of isolated, consistent, and portable development enviromnents. When using containers for development you will not have to install ELN dependencies locally on your machine.
Instead, depencencies and installation details are limited to the container (or more specifically, the underlying image, more on that later).
This can keep your machine free of clutter, and more importantly, ensure consistent development environments across contributors (i.e., avoiding "works on my machine" scenarios).

## Windows
This guide will help you getting started developing with containers on Windows using Docker Desktop along with [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (referred to as `WSL-2` in the following).
The instructions have been tested on Windows 10, ensure your machine is running Windows 10, version 2004, Build 18362 or higher.

### Dependencies
Start by installing the following depencencies:
- [WSL-2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). While going through the WSL-2 installation, make sure to install WSL-2, not WSL-1. Also, make sure to install `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` as your Linux distribution.
- [Desktop Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

### Setup
With Docker Desktop you can work in a Linux-based development environment and run Linux-based containers while using an IDE on Windows
for editing and debugging (e.g., Visual Studio Code). Start by enabling the WSL-2 backend in Docker Desktop.


Set docker desktop setting (Docker Desktop Stable 2.3.0.2 https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/)
- From the Docker menu, select Settings > General.
- Select: Use WSL-2 based engine check box.
- Select: Enable integration with additional distro
- Enable: Ubuntu-20.04




The setup continues with the following steps:





Set a path on PowerShell (Windows)



```
cd c:\chemotion\...
```



Now, test Docker in your “WSL–2 Ubuntu 20.04“ console session. Open PowerShell console, and execute the following command to check the Docker version



```
docker --version
```
Once docker has been running on WSL-2. you could switch to ubutun 20.04 to clone the project https://github.com/ptrxyz/chemotion




Your C: drive is mounted to



```
/mnt/c
```
### Optional
Set a path of PostgreSQL on docker-compose.yml
db:
- /home/chemotion/db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/

You can proceed to the next step in the Docker installation by navigating [here](DevDocker).

### Tools recommended for development

#### Visual Studio Code
- Install Visual studio code with linters set up (es and ruby-rubocop):
  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rebornix.Ruby && https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint

- Install version control extension
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol

- Install the VS Code Docker extension. This extension adds the functionality to build, manage, and deploy containerized applications from inside VS Code. (You need the Remote-Container extension to actually use the container as your dev environment.)

#### Vim

## Linux

## macOS
Development with Docker Desktop is recommended.

## Limitations
some tests are disabled with Docker development
