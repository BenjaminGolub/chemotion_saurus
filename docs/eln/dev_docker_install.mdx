:::info
Documentation and processes are being reworked and improved at the moment. Please [contact](specific_contact) us for installation of a development version of the ELN.

:::


## Introduction
Containers enable the use of isolated, consistent, and portable development enviromnents. When using containers for development you will not have to install and configure the ELN locally on your machine.
Instead, depencencies and configurations are maintained in container-images which you can run on your machine using Docker.
This keeps your machine free of clutter, and more importantly, it can ensure consistent development environments across contributors (i.e., avoiding "works on my machine" scenarios).
Have a look at this [tutorial](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/docker-introduction/01-introduction/index.html) for an accessible introduction to containers.

## Windows
This guide will help you getting started developing with containers on Windows using `Docker Desktop` along with [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (referred to as `WSL 2` in the following).
With `Docker Desktop` you can work in a Linux-based development environment and run Linux-based containers while using an IDE on Windows for editing and debugging (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
The instructions have been tested on Windows 10. Your machine should run Windows 10, version 2004, Build 18362 or higher.

### Dependencies

#### WSL 2
Start by [installing `WSL 2`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
:::important
While going through the `WSL 2` installation, make sure to install `WSL 2`, not `WSL 1`. Also, make sure to install `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` (referred to as `Ubuntu` in the following) as your Linux distribution.
:::
Next, [open a `WSL 2` terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#ways-to-run-wsl) and [set up a user account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/user-support).

#### Docker Desktop
Once you have installed `WSL 2` you can [install `Docker Desktop` and enable the `WSL 2` backend in `Docker Desktop`](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/).
For additional information and prerequisites regarding the installation of `Docker Desktop` also have a look [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) (the instructions above should be sufficient though).

### Setup
Once you have `WSL 2` and `Docker Desktop` installed, you can start setting up the ELN development enviromnent.
The development enviromnent consists of the ELN source code as well as two Docker images containing all depencencies and configurations of the ELN runtime.

Make sure that all files you'll download in the following steps live in the Linux file system, *not* in your Windows file system ([here's why](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/#best-practices)).
The Windows file system (e.g., C: drive) is mounted into `Ubuntu` under `/mnt`. Therefore, store your files somewhere else than `/mnt`. For example,
you could store them in your home directory (`~`).

Also, make sure that you're running all commands from a `WSL 2` terminal (`$` command prompt), i.e., from within `Ubuntu`, not Windows PowerShell (`>` command prompt).
You won't be able to run bash scripts from PowerShell.

On your Windows machine, [open a `WSL 2` terminal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#ways-to-run-wsl).
Next, start `Docker Desktop`. You can confirm that `Docker Desktop` is running by typing `docker --version` in the `WSL 2` terminal.
If you get a response you're now ready to proceed with the setup as outlined [here](DevDocker#Setup).


## Linux

## macOS
Development with `Docker Desktop` is recommended.

## Tools recommended for development

### Visual Studio Code
- Install Visual studio code with linters set up (es and ruby-rubocop):
  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rebornix.Ruby && https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint

- Install version control extension
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol

- Install the VS Code Docker extension. This extension adds the functionality to build, manage, and deploy containerized applications from inside VS Code. (You need the Remote-Container extension to actually use the container as your dev environment.)

### Vim
Check https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale.



## Limitations
Some tests are disabled with Docker development.
