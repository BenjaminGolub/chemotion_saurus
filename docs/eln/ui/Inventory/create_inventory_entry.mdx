### Chemical Entry

A chemical Entry can be created by creating a new sample as an inventory entry. Please refer to [Generate Sample](../elements/samples#generation) section, to learn how to create a new sample. Once a new sample is created, user can check in the inventory check box to enable handling of a sample as a chemical entry.

### Inventory Tab

The inventory tab will appear in the Tabs Layout. User can make the inventory tab visible by drag and drop, if it is hidden by default. Once the inventory tab is active, user can start entering chemical data in the corresponding fields.

![Inventory Tab](/img/inventory_tab.gif)

** The inventory tab is organized into a hierarchical structure consisting of three collapsible lists, outlined below: **

1. [Inventory Information List](#inventory-information-list),
1. [Safety List](#safety-list),
1. [Location and Information List](#location-and-information-list) 

This structure enables convenient navigation and organization of data for a chemical inventory entry.

## Inventory Information List:

This section contains the following fields:

* `status:` List of 4 options for status of the chemical (available, out of stock, to be ordered, and ordered).
* `vendor:` The vendor associated with the chemical order.
* `order number:` The order number of the chemical.
* `amount:` Contains information about the amount of the chemical.
* `unit:` The unit of measurement for the chemical's amount.
* `price:` The price of the ordered chemical.
* `person:` Contact person associated with the chemical.
* `ordered date:` The date when the chemical was ordered.
* `required data:` The date when person or entity required the chemical.
* `required by:` The person or entity that required or ordered the chemical.


## Safety List:

* The Safety section is an interactive feature that allows users to search for and access safety data sheets (SDS) and safety phrases related to specific chemicals.
* Users can select the vendor associated with their query, choosing from the <Btn mixed={["Vendor"]} color={"secondary"} /> drop-down list options such as All, Thermo Fischer, and Merck. Selecting "All" will search for SDS on both vendors' websites.
* The <Btn mixed={["Query SDS using"]} color={"secondary"} /> button provides a dropdown list for users to select whether to search using the CAS (Chemical Abstracts Service) number or common name of the chemical.
* The <Btn mixed={["Choose Language of SDS"]} color={"secondary"} /> dropdown list offers three language options: English, German, and French. If no results are found with the chosen language, results will be displayed with the default query language (English).
* After selecting the search parameters, users can initiate the search query by clicking the <Btn mixed={["Search for SDS"]} color={"secondary"} /> button.
* The search results will be displayed, and users can click on the results *tag link* to open a new tab directing them to the vendor's safety data sheet.
* It is recommended for users or administrators to first verify if the displayed results are associated with the desired chemical.
* If results match the specific chemical, users can save the safety sheet to the Electronic Laboratory Notebook (ELN) by clicking the save button next to the relevant result tag. A green check mark icon will appear next to result element tag, if SDS is saved successfully. 
* Once saved, users can initiate additional search queries to retrieve safety phrases or search for chemical and physical properties related to the chemical.
* Users have the option to delete the saved data sheet by clicking the delete icon <Btn mixed={[faTrash]} color={"danger"}/> button.
* The <Btn mixed={["Search for SDS"]} color={"secondary"} /> button will be disabled, once one SDS is saved. To enable another search query, user have to delete any saved SDS first.
* Additionally, users can access the vendor's product webpage by clicking the external link icon <Btn mixed={[faExternalLink]} color={"secondary"} /> button.
* User can query the safety phrases for this chemical from vendor by clicking the <Btn mixed={["fetch safety phrases"]} color={"secondary"} /> button. Results render below as depicted in the image below.

* The <Btn mixed={["fetch Chemical Properties"]} color={"secondary"} /> button enable users to make a search query for chemical and physical properties related to the chemical and save it to respective fields in sample properties tab. 
Sometimes fetched results can not be saved automatically if fetched values can not be accepted by ELN for some fields. User in this case can view and modify entered values manually.
Fetched properties can be viewed by clicking the results icon <Btn mixed={[faFileText]} color={"secondary"} /> button next to fetch button. An example of fetch chemical properties process is shown below.

## Location and Information List:
The Location field is devided into 2 subsections `host location, host group` which reflects information about owner of chemical and `current location, current group` in case chemical is borrowed by another group/person. Both subsections have overlapping fields.
* `building, room, cabinet` where the chemical is stored.
* `group:` related to the chemical.
* `owner:` the person responsible for the chemical.
* `by:` the person which borrowed the chemical.

User can use `Disposal information` field to save any information related to the disposal of the chemical or use `important notes` field to save any other relative information. User can click the save button, after making any changes or updating any field inside the inventory tab to save the changes. The save button is located at the bottom of the inventory tab.
