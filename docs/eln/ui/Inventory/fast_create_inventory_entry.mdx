### Split sample for chemical entry

The process of creating a chemical entry in the Electronic Laboratory Notebook (ELN) involves initially creating a sample. 
However, users also have the option to generate a new chemical entry through the [Split Sample](/docs/eln/ui/elements/samples#generation-of-samples-from-existing-samples-or-molecules) feature.  
For further information on how to utilize this feature, please consult the [Split Sample](/docs/eln/ui/elements/samples#generation-of-samples-from-existing-samples-or-molecules) section. 
When a split sample is performed, the newly generated chemical entry inherits the data from the original entry.
Subsequently, users are able to modify the data according to their specific requirements.

### Drag and drop chemical entry

Users have the capability to employ a drag-and-drop action to transfer a chemical entry from the inventory list to a reaction, thereby generating a subsample derived from the original chemical entry.
In this process, only safety information pertaining to the subsample is generated. 
Subsequently, users can conveniently navigate to the inventory tab of the created subsample to access and review the corresponding safety information.
The gif below illustrates the drag-and-drop action for the generation of a subsample from a chemical enty.
