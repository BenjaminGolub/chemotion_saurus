This feature allows users to be able to edit attachments by using their local application without requiring them to download and upload the attachment.
This feature has already been tested with applications like Microsoft Office, ChemDraw and MestreNova(Mnova).

:::danger Caution:
We suggest to use .mnova file extension to work with Mnova instead of .jdx or .dx.
In case you are using Mnova application to edit .jdx or .dx file, when you are saving the changes, you will see the
file extension was change from .jdx or .dx to .mnova . Please correct it, ortherwise your changes will not updated in ELN server.
