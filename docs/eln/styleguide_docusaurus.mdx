# Images
* If you're adding an image to illustrate a paragraph, place the image after the corresponding paragraph.

# Naming
* Refer to the Chemotion Electronic Lab Notebook as `Chemotion ELN`.

# Titles
* Capitalize only the first word of a title.

# Tables
* Do not capitalize words inside tables.

# Automatic style checking
By every push to the chemotion_saurus repository an automatic style guide checking is running. Naming typos are fixed and titles are capitalized within an automatic push to the repository, after the initial push from the user and will be deployed within the next push from a user. If tables contain uppercased words or the commited file is missing in the TOC, warning or error messages are printed in the `Style Guide Parser` step in the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_saurus/actions). Style checking can be skipped with the command `skip style guide` in the commit message.
