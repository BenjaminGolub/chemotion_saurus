## Status badge
A status badge per workflow can also be added to the `README` file. For quickly getting the Markdown code for a status badge go to the Actions tab on the GitHUb repository, click on the workflow, click on the dots on the right upper corner and click on `Create status badge`.

## Common Errors
### Random seed numbers
The most common error for failing ruby unit tests are caused by seed numbers. Just run the tests multiple times again, until a suitable seed number is found.

### Yarn packages
A lot of errors are caused by a wrong Node or npm version or missing yarn packages:
<div class="boxBorder">
> test  

> mocha --require '@babel/register' './spec/javascripts/helper/setup.js' './spec/javascripts/**/*.spec.js'

sh: 1: mocha: not found
</div>

```sh
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use 14.16.0 && yarn install
```

### Database
After `bundle exec db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test` this error occurs:
<div class="boxBorder">
bundle exec rake db: migrate failed

rake aborted!
StandardError: An error has occurred, this and all later migrations canceled:

undefined method `id' for nil:NilClass
</div>

```sh
bundle exec rake db:reset
bundle exec db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
```
