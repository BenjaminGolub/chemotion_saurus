## Prerequisites
You will need a Radar4Chem account and workspace to use this integration.

## Maintaining Metadata
When preparing data for archiving to Radar4Chem, it is important to maintain the appropriate metadata information. Metadata information such as subject, rights holder, and rights are required and can be maintained in the metadata editor in Chemotion ELN. Once you have entered this information, be sure to save it by clicking the "Save" button in the top-right corner of the metadata editor.

## Preparing Data for Archiving
To archive data to Radar4Chem, select the collection you want to archive and click on "Archive current collection to RADAR". If the minimum required information has not yet been maintained, the "Archive to RADAR" button will be disabled. In this case, click on the "Edit collection metadata" button to add the required metadata.

## Archiving to Radar
Once the required metadata has been added and saved, the "Archive to RADAR" button will become available. Clicking on this button will initiate the data transfer to Radar4Chem.

If you do not have any workspaces associated with your account, you will not be able to archive data to Radar4Chem and you will see the following message:

![no_workspaces](/img/interfaces/no_workspaces.png)

Once you have clicked the "Export" button, the data will begin exporting to Radar4Chem. A message will appear indicating that your export is uploaded to Radar4Chem and you will be redirected once the upload is complete.
