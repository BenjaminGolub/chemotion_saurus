The Chemotion-ELN is being developed in an initiative of the Br√§se working group at the Institute for Organic Chemistry (IOC) of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The involved developers work on the north campus of KIT in the COMPLAT group.  
The Chemotion ELN is being developed with the help of chemists for chemists. In future applications, related disciplines should also be included in the further development.
We would like to thank many other institutions and developers who contributed code, ideas and finished subcomponents. The ELN could only come into being with the support of developers from NinjaConcept and Cubuslab. Further sub-components are available through the cooperation with NMRdb and SciFinder.  
The project has been funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) since 2015.  
If this laboratory journal is used in your laboratory, we would be very happy to receive a short message. It gives us the opportunity to document the number of users in order to prove the interest in our journal.  
The team looks forward to any kind of feedback, suggestions and criticism (chemotion[at]ioc.kit.edu).

The ELN supports the uploap of in principle every dataset that's provided. The file size restriction is set by the admin of the ELN instance and can be varied. 
If open file formats are available, spectra viewers can visualize the data and may allow their editing. Chemotion ELN supports at the moment Chemspectra as data viewer, NMRium is going to be implemented soon.
