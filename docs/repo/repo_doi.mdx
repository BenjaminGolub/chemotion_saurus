**Different types of DOIs in chemotion repository**

Chemotion repository generates different DOI-types for the submitted data:
- Collection DOIs: 
- Reaction DOIs: 
- Sample DOIs: 
- Analysis (Datasets) DOIs:

**Why do scientists benefit from DOIs?**
The use of DOIs allows scientists to point directly to data that was generated along with their research. The users can cite not only a whole dataset but also single data on e.g. the characterization of a specific compound or the experimental details of a reaction.
The collection DOI can be used to summarize a collection of data (ideally belonging to one publication) which allows to refer to and cite all data that describe one study. Using the DOI link in supplemental information parts means that every experiment can be cited and further reuse of the full information is facilitated due to a direct link to the data - without the need to search in databases. 

**How to generate DOIs?, when are DOIs available?**
DOIs are generated automaticallyin the repository - there is no need for action. Users just need to know where to find DOIs and how to use them. The DOIs are created (reserved) directly when the user submits a reaction or sample. After the information requested in the submission panel is added and the submission is completed, the DOIs are created. 
At this stage, the DOIs can be copied and used for the referencing in SIs and publications, but the DOis don't resolve yet. Therefore, the data is not accessible to a others. The DOIs will resolve at the time the dataset is release and published. 

:::info
DOIs are created directly with the submission of data to chemotion repository - but they resolve only after disclosure of the datasets - with the public accessibility of the data.
Here, some action is needed, please see section on how to release an embargo: https://www.chemotion.net/docs/repo/embargo_topics#release-an-embargo

**Explanation of DOI-structure**



**How to use DOIs in publications and SI**
There are different options to use DOIs in publications. Following, we descibed the recommended way of where the DOIs should be placed. An explanation of how to gain this in a feasible manner without the need of entering all DOIs manually is described elsewhere
