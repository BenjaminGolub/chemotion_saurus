**Different types of DOIs in chemotion repository**

Chemotion repository generates different DOI-types for the submitted data:
- Collection DOIs: 
- Reaction DOIs: 
- Sample DOIs: 
- Analysis (Datasets) DOIs:

**Why do scientists benefit from DOIs?**

The use of DOIs allows scientists to point directly to data that was generated along with their research. The users can cite not only a whole dataset but also single data on e.g. the characterization of a specific compound or the experimental details of a reaction.
The collection DOI can be used to summarize a collection of data (ideally belonging to one publication) which allows to refer to and cite all data that describe one study. Using the DOI link in supplemental information parts means that every experiment can be cited and further reuse of the full information is facilitated due to a direct link to the data - without the need to search in databases. 

**How to generate DOIs?, when are DOIs available?**

DOIs are generated automaticallyin the repository - there is no need for action. Users just need to know where to find DOIs and how to use them. The DOIs are created (reserved) directly when the user submits a reaction or sample. After the information requested in the submission panel is added and the submission is completed, the DOIs are created. 
At this stage, the DOIs can be copied and used for the referencing in SIs and publications, but the DOis don't resolve yet. Therefore, the data is not accessible to a others. The DOIs will resolve at the time the dataset is release and published. 

:::info
DOIs are created directly with the submission of data to chemotion repository - but they resolve only after disclosure of the datasets - with the public accessibility of the data.
Here, some action is needed, please see section on how to release an embargo: https://www.chemotion.net/docs/repo/embargo_topics#release-an-embargo

**Explanation of DOI-structure**<br />
DOIs consist of a prefix and a suffix. DOI links include additionally "https://". DOIs created by chemotion repository contain the prefix "dx.doi.org/10.14272/" which is combined with a speficic suffix for collections, reactions, samples and analyses. DOIs contain a numerical counter to indicate how ofter items are submitted, that consist of a similar content.<br />

**Example for typical collection DOI:** https://dx.doi.org/10.14272/collection/AAL_2022-12-18_2. <br />
Explanation: "https://"(link) + "dx.doi.org/10.14272"(prefix) + "/collection"(indicator for type of DOI) + "AAL_2022-12-18_2"(label of the collection).<br />
**Example for typical reaction DOI:** https://dx.doi.org/10.14272/reaction/SA-FUHFF-UHFFFADPSC-WSUGZWJXIM-UHFFFADPSC-NUHFF-NAKRX-NUHFF-ZZZ <br />
Explanation: "https://"(link) + "dx.doi.org/10.14272"(prefix) + "reaction"(indicator for type of DOI) + "/SA-FUHFF-UHFFFADPSC-WSUGZWJXIM-UHFFFADPSC-NUHFF-NAKRX-NUHFF-ZZZ"(InCHIkey identifier for the reaction).<br />
**Example for typical sample DOI:** https://dx.doi.org/10.14272/WSUGZWJXIMLXNZ-WUKNDPDISA-N.1 <br />
Explanation: "https://"(link) + "dx.doi.org/10.14272"(prefix) + "/WSUGZWJXIMLXNZ-WUKNDPDISA-N"(InCHIkey of molecule) + ".1"(numer of repetition in repository).<br />
**Example for typical analysis DOI:** https://dx.doi.org/10.14272/WSUGZWJXIMLXNZ-WUKNDPDISA-N/CHMO0000593<br />
Explanation: "https://"(link) + "dx.doi.org/10.14272"(prefix) + "/WSUGZWJXIMLXNZ-WUKNDPDISA-N"(InCHIkey of molecule) + "/CHMO0000593"(label of the collection).<br />

**How to use DOIs in publications and SI**<br />
There are different options to use DOIs in publications. Following, we descibed the recommended way of where the DOIs should be placed. An explanation of how to gain this in a feasible manner without the need of entering all DOIs manually is described elsewhere.  

**DOIs in supplemental information or methods' section:** <br />
Please add DOIs to your Supportig information or the exterimental/methods part of your main manuscript. Please use at least one DOI per experiment (the reaction DOI), in this case the DOI of the reaction (as the repository then links to samples and their characterization). If possible, please include DOIs for the experiment (the reaction DOI) and the sample (as the repository then links the characterization/analyses). Sometimes it might be helpful to point to specific analyses. Following you will find an example on how to include reaction DOIs and sample DOIs to a Supplemental Part: 
 
1H-Quinoxalin-2-one (S2a): Benzene-1,2-diamine (5.00 g, 46.2 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and ethyl 2-oxoacetate (50% in toluene, 10.4 g, 10.1 mL, 50.9 mmol, 1.10 equiv) in 80 mL of THF was stirred at 75 °C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to 25 °C; the resulting white-yellow precipitate was isolated by filtration and THF was evaporated from the filtrate under reduced pressure. The remaining solid was rinsed out with DCM and added to the solid residue. Subsequently the combined solid precipitate was washed 3x with distilled water, transferred to a flask and dried under high vacuum. The product 1H-quinoxalin-2-one (6.66 g, 45.6 mmol, 99% yield) was obtained as a white solid.

**DOIs for publishers** 
Publishers request information on the repository where data is deposited during the manuscript submission process. Please refer in those cases to chemotion repository. If the publisher requires a persistent identifier of the repository, please refer to: fairsharing_DOI:10.25504/FAIRsharing.iagXcR. 
Usually, publishers request the collection DOIs of the data deposit. In those cases, please give the collection DOI as described above.
