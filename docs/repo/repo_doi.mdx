**Why do scientists benefit from DOIs?**


**How to generate DOIs?, when are DOIs available?**
DOIs are generated automaticallyin the repository - there is no need for action. Users just need to know where to find DOIs and how to use them. The DOIs are created (reserved) directly when the user submits a reaction or sample. After the information requested in the submission panel is added and the submission is completed, the DOIs are created. 
At this stage, the DOIs can be copied and used for the referencing in SIs and publications, but the DOis don't resolve yet. Therefore, the data is not accessible to a others. The DOIs will resolve at the time the dataset is release and published.
