## General aspects

Please ensure that the description of the reaction is as comprehensive as possible. The description of the reaction needs to be understandable and reproducible. 
- Please ensure that no abbreviations are used that need further explanations. If you need to add abbreviations, please define them in "additional information for publication and purification". 
- Please use the exact name of the given reagents instead of general terms such as "the amine", "the aldehyde", the "starting material"
- Please add the distinct temperture instead of RT, if not otherwise possible as a range
- Please add the duration of a reaction as precise as possible and avoid "over night"

## Units

Please adjust the space between number and unit according to common standards:  
All combinations of number and unit should be given with space, only the combination number+% (e.g. yield or concentration) are given without.

12 h (wrong: 12h)  <!--truncate-->
12 min (wrong: 12min)  
12 °C (not 12°C)  
12 mM (wrong: 12mM)  

But: the product was obtained in 12% yield  
Or: 5% methanol in water

## Abbreviations and names
Please avoid misunderstandings due to inaccurate names and descriptions:   
**Right**: cyclohexane (wrong: cyclo)
