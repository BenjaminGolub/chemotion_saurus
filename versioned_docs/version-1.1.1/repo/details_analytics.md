## Purity of the measured samples and quality of datasets
## Purity and impurities

The quality of the datasets is important for the utility of the repository. Therefore, please check carefully the purity of your compounds before you provide your data. Avoidable by-products or solvents in the spectra won’t be tolerated by the reviewers and the data will be sent back for revision or will be rejected. <!--truncate-->  
If your spectra contain impurities that can’t be removed (isomerization during measurement or similar issues) please indicate the impurities, the percentage of impurities and their origin (if known) clearly in all types of analysis.  
Example: 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6, ppm) δ = 13.23 (bs, 2H, CO2H), 8.24 (d, 1H, J = 1.5 Hz, CH), 8.17 (dd, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz, 1.5 Hz, CH), 8.05 (m, 2H, CH), 7.81 (d, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz, CH), 7.63 (m, 2H, CH), 7.49 (m, 2H, CH).   
Impurities: 10% impurities due to the formation of the cis-isomer during the measurement of the sample.   
Alternative:   
Impurities: 1% ethyl acetate, unknown impurities at 1.11-2.22 ppm and 3.33 ppm.
or:   
1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6, ppm) δ = 13.23 (bs, 2H, CO2H), 8.24 (d, 1H, J = 1.5 Hz, CH), 8.17 (dd, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz, 1.5 Hz, CH), 8.05 (m, 2H, CH), 7.81 (d, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz, CH), 7.63 (m, 2H, CH), 7.49 (m, 2H, CH).  
Impurities: This spectrum contains around 5% impurities at 7.66 ppm and 2.44 ppm due to an unknown by-product.

## Missing signals 

Proton and carbon spectra will be automatically validated by the number of protons and carbons given in the analysis in comparison with the number of atoms given by the sum formula. Therefore: if there are missing signals e.g. (due to proton exchange of acidic protons or carbon signals that are too broad to be detected) please add this information to the analysis in the form “Missing Signal (1H, OH) due to....”, “1H is missing (1H, OH)” or “1C is missing (1C, Cq)” and so on.  
Example: 1H NMR (500 MHz, MeOD-d4, ppm) δ = 13.23 (bs, 2H, CO2H), 8.24 (d, 1H, J = 1.5 Hz, CH), 8.17 (dd, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz, 1.5 Hz, CH), 8.05 (m, 2H, CH), 7.81 (d, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz, CH), 7.63 (m, 2H, CH), 7.49 (m, 2H, CH). Missing Signal (1H, OH) due to H/D exchange in MeOD-d4.  
Important with respect to the format: please add the information on the number and type of missing signals in brackets and use a comma to separate from other information within the bracket (1H, xx). 

## Order of analyses
Please order the analysis part of your molecules/samples according to 
1. 1H NMR
2. 13C NMR and other NMR data
3. mass data
4. IR data
5. others (EA, crystal structures)
Please use the “order mode” button in the analysis tab.
