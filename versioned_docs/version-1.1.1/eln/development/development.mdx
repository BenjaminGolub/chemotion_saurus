## Debugging

### JavaScript
You can use your browser's developer tools:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools

### Ruby (Rails application)
Below are two options for "live"-debugging Ruby code (i.e., while the application is running).

#### Pry
Install [`pry`](https://github.com/pry/pry) and set `binding.pry` breakpoints in your Ruby code:
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/pry_debugging.html. Pry should work independently of your IDE.

#### Visual Studio Code
If you're using the Visual Studio Code IDE, you can use it's visual / GUI debugger.
The configuration depends on your local setup, however, following these instructions should get you started fine:

In case debugging doesn't work yet, have a look at the following resources to fine-tune your configuration:

https://github.com/rubyide/vscode-ruby/blob/main/docs/debugger.md
https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-recipes/blob/2174a750102a76142378ea08dbbb4a576dc6d1d5/debugging-Ruby-on-Rails/README.md

## Linting
For linting and formatting Ruby and JavaScript, [RuboCop](https://rubocop.org/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) are used respectively.
They can be used with the following commands from the inside of a Chemotion ELN installation directory.
The flags `-a` or `-x` for rubocop and `--fix` for ESLint are for correcting and therefore changing the code.
Without the flags errors or warnings are displayed, but no changes are made to the code.
```sh
rubocop [-a | -x] [paths]
yarn run eslint [--fix] [paths]
```
When ESLint detects linting errors, it will finishes by default with the exit code 1.
This can lead to scripts being terminated with error codes in some environments (e. g. GitHub Actions).
To avoid this the [eslint-plugin-only-warn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-only-warn) can be added via yarn which returns warnings instead of errors.
The plugin needs to be activated with a flag in the ESLint command:
```sh
yarn run eslint --plugin eslint-plugin-only-warn [--fix] [paths]
```
There are [Linting extensions for Visual Studio Code](#visual-studio-code) available.
## Tools recommended for development

### Visual Studio Code
- Install Visual studio code with linters set up (ESLint and RuboCop):
  - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rebornix.Ruby
  - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint

- Install version control extension
  - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github
  - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol


### Vim
Check https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale.

## Webpack
### Debug
The webpack configurations can be printed to the node console via:
```sh
RAILS_ENV=test node -e 'console.dir(require("config/webpack/test"), { depth: null })'
```
